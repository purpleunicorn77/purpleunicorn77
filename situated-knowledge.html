<h2>Situated Knowledge</h2>
<br>
<p> 🦚 MA Project: “Situated knowledges require that the object of knowledge be pictured as an actor and agent, not as a screen or a ground or a resource.” (Haraway, 1988, P.592)
In this project, I represented my own experience as a human being and immersed myself in a reflective process.</p>
<p> 🦚 Tools: Adobe Illustrator, Figma, 3D Workshop</p>
<p> 🦚 Here, I highlight my creative expertise in using hands-on tools and crafting compelling video edits.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>🦚 Thinking Process 🦚</p></b>
<p>I live in one of the world's largest cities — a place driven by consumerism and capitalism. I imagine myself at the center of it all, as if the world revolves within a luxury department store, layered like a cake.</p>

<br>
<b><p>🦚 Reflection 🦚</p></b>
<p>1. What does capitalism bring to society?</p>
<p>2. How does it affect our lives and culture?</p>
<p>3. What are the politics in consumer capitalism?</p>
<br>
<b><p>🦚 Feedback 🦚</p></b>
<p> I should do more research on capitalism.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>Prototype - with more studies</p></b>

<b><p>🦚 The cake theory 🦚</p></b>
<p>Cake theory emerged in 2010. It is a metaphor for the economic development in China, where the wealth gap was gradually growing and becoming apparent. One side of the debate suggested development should focus on dividing the cake more evenly, the other said it should be focused on baking the cake bigger.</p>

<b><p>🌿 Conclusion 🌿</p></b>
<p> As far as the capitalist structure and actors were concerned, I was told they were not strong enough to express my thoughts. First of all, I need to enhance the image of capitalism, yet I have not made the dark side of capitalism. This was the challenge I faced. I was running out of ideas as the books I read only talked about capitalism, but they did not give any solutions for the negative parts of capitalism. I thought about a few keywords: Hierarchy, Layers, and the Service industry. The word “Cake” came out, and I checked any relationship between “Cake” and “Capitalism”, and I found The Cake Theory. There are definitely more space I need to improve, I wish I could have more time to explain my thoughts clearly.</p>

<h2>RESOURCEFUL</h2>
<br>
<p> 🌿 MA Group Project: RESOURCEFUL explores how we adjust to life in a climate emergency. With living standards decreasing and our health and wellbeing under threat, the present moment feels increasingly unstable. A safer and more equitable future is clearly desirable, even necessary, but what might it look like?</p>
<p> 🌿 Tools: Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, TouchDesigner, 3D Workshop</p>
<p> 🌿 This page highlights my expertise in refining presentation materials that captivate diverse audiences from different backgrounds.</p>
<p> 🌿 Some graphic credits go to Xiong Ying, Wei, and Muqing.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>🌿 Initial Ideas 🌿</p></b>
<p>My thinking process started from Net Zero, but eventually went for Climate Justice and Green Transition. As our teammates wanted to explore more of those topics.</p>
<br>
<b><p>Idea 1: A body in the form of a planet: Gaia and Philosophy</p></b>
<p>“That life interacts with and eventually becomes its own environments; that the atmosphere is an extension of the biosphere in nearly the same sense that the human mind is an extension of DNA.” (Sagan, D. and Margulis, L., 2023, p.26)</p>
<b><p>Idea 2: Zombie Media - Tamagotchi</p></b>
<p>"Media in its various layers embodies memory: not only human memory but also the
memory of things, of objects, of chemicals, and of circuits."
(Hertz,Garnet D. and Parikka J., 2012, p.425)</p>
<b><p>Idea 3: Rewilding with Synthetic Biology (2013 - 2015)</p></b>
<p>Designing for the Sixth Extinction investigates synthetic biology’s potential impact on biodiversity and con-
servation. The thought questioned us if we could endure rewilding - the conservation
movement that lets nature take control by using synthetic biology to improve the
nature?</p>
<br>
<b><p>🌿 Research 🌿</p></b>
<p>Example 1: Israeli plant regulation VS Palestinian herb-picking culture</p>
<p>Example 2: The Green Colonialism of Norway’s Wind Power Boom</p>
<br>
<b><p>🌿 Feedback 🌿</p></b>
<p>As there is no right and wrong in building wind turbines, it is a tool to save global warming. Still, there are plenty of compromises and sacrifices; both the Sàmi people and the Norwegian government need to negotiate. We aim to reveal the story behind the
scenes of the green transition, for the audience to think about Climate Injustice.</p>

<b><p>🌿 Conclusion 🌿</p></b>
<p>This project was incredibly valuable, as it taught us how to effectively collaborate with our peers. We learned how to navigate differing opinions and reach a consensus that everyone could agree on—without compromising deadlines. It also challenged us to stay motivated, even when the final design didn’t fully align with our personal preferences. Ultimately, this experience gave us a better understanding of what it’s like to work as part of a team in a professional setting.

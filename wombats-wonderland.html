<h2>Wombats Wonderlands</h2>
<br>
<p> 👾 Personal Project: E-commerce, retail webpage practice. Inspired by Wombats, I created a pet store online shopping landing page.</p>
<p> 👾 Tools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Figma</p>
<p> 👾 This page showcases my expertise in digital design, with a focus on eCommerce website development.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>👾 Initial Idea 👾</p></b>
<br>
<b><p>What is an e-commerce landing page?</p></b>
<p>An eCommerce landing page is a purpose-driven page designed to achieve a single goal—whether that's encouraging visitors to purchase a product or sign up for a service. Typically created for a specific campaign, this dedicated page works best when paired with compelling ads, helping to increase conversion rates by guiding visitors toward a clear and focused action.

<b><p>Do I really need a landing page for ecommerce?</p></b>
<p>Most of the retail businesses nowadays need to expand their exposure, as money makes more money, people browse the internet more without physically going out. Therefore, an e-commerce landing page is really important. </p>
<br>
<b><p>As e-commerce retail is currently overnumbered, how do I stand out for my start-up business?</p></b>
<p>Keep trying and use strong marketing and products to attract customers. By launching campaigns faster than others, delivering clear messages, targeting specific audiences, and providing a better experience.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>👾 Research 👾</p></b>
<p>From my experience in the retail industry, several key factors influence a business's long-term success, such as product variety, design, quality, pricing, brand image, and after-sales service. These elements also affect customer satisfaction, the likelihood of information spreading, and overall customer traffic.
Whether a product is high-end or more budget-friendly can impact how customers perceive it and whether it fits their financial situation. When designing an e-commerce page, it's essential to consider who your audience is and how easy the site will be for them to purchase the items.
Strong communication between the design and marketing teams is also crucial to ensure the page reflects the company’s brand identity. This ties closely into the roles of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design. In the end, successful web design relies on teamwork and collaboration.</p>
<br>
<p>For this project, I worked independently without a team. However, I’ve previously been part of the marketing team at the Institute for Information Industry in Taiwan, where the graphic designer was primarily responsible for webpage design, along with some aspects of user experience. In my own project, I’ve chosen to focus specifically on page design and the user interface, as these are the areas I want to highlight.

<br>
<p>With this information, I can certainly create a basic landing page for the project. And through the project, I am aiming to learn more design marketing strategies.</p>

<b><p>👾 Background Story 👾</p></b>
<p>This start-up pet shop, featuring a wombat logo, is designed to attract pet lovers to shop online. The brand uses a soft, natural color palette with macaron-inspired tones, reflecting the idea that every pet is cherished like a child by their owner.

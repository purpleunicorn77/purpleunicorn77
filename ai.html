<h2>AI Prediction</h2>
<br>
<p>ðŸ§¬ MA Project: What is scrying mirror? - AI vs Database</p>
<p>ðŸ§¬ This project explores the importance of approaching AI critically, particularly given the growing trust in its ability to predict the future. </p>
<p>ðŸ§¬ This project highlights my research skills and demonstrates my ability to translate them into visual communication.</p>
<p>ðŸ§¬ Tools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe After Effect and Adobe Premiere Pro</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>ðŸ§¬ Initial Idea ðŸ§¬</p></b>
<b><p>Idea 1: The rise of machine learning and AI</b></p>
<b><p>Idea 2: Critically view the growing power of AI</b></p>
<b><p>Idea 3: Trust in AI?</b></p>
<b><p>Idea 4: The AI Death Calculator - Digital divination</b></p>
<b><p>Idea 5: How can we see it critically?</b></p>
<br>
<b><p>ðŸ§¬ Research ðŸ§¬</b></p>
<p>My research inspiration was from this ancient device, examining its historical origins dating back to the 16th century and contrasting it with its modern counterpart in AI computer programs. Critique is directed towards contemporary scrying mirrors, particularly those embedded within computer systems</p>
<br>
<b><p>ðŸ§¬ Feedback ðŸ§¬</b></p>
<p>Read more human behavior books so I could find out more future prediction information.</p>
<br>
<b><p>Prototype: Present this case study in different media.</b></p>

<b><p>ðŸ§¬ Email Campaign ðŸ§¬</b></p>
<p>An email campaign is a series of marketing efforts that are sent via email to multiple people at once. The goal of an email campaign is to entice the recipients to purchase a product or service or to learn more about the business. </p>
<p>In my project, I just want to communicate the information to my audience if they subscribe to the email regarding AI-related articles. Each article has its hyperlink, which would take the audience to the relevant webpage.</p>
<p>Here is the email campaign layout design.</p>

<b><p>ðŸ§¬ Conclusion ðŸ§¬</b></p>
<p>This project took about a month from initial concept to final delivery, all completed within the deadline. Throughout the process, I gained valuable experience, especially in installing a terminal-based chatbot, which required applying my Python skills. I also created a set of supporting design materials to complement the project. One of the key lessons I learned was how to communicate design ideas visually, without needing to explain them verbally. I'm proud that the participants genuinely enjoyed the outcome. The journey from research to ideation wasn't easy, but thanks to the constructive feedback from my tutors, I was able to stay on track and reach the finish line.</p>

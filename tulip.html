<h2>Taipei Tulip Festival</h2>
<br>
<p> ðŸŒ· Personal Project: Rebrand Taipei CKS Shilin Residence Tulip Festival.</p>
<p> ðŸŒ· Tools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Figma</p>
<p> ðŸŒ· This page highlights my expertise in rebranding campaigns.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>ðŸŒ· Brand Story ðŸŒ·</p></b>
<p>Surrounded by majestic mountains and meandering rivers
Taipei, a city where flowers bloom all year round, brings forth a vibrant spectacle.
From every corner of the city. The flowers of Taipei welcome you. 
Join the celebration and revel in the cityâ€™s floral tapestry.
Discover the blossoming charm of Flowers in Taipei. (Flowers In Taipei, 2025)</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>ðŸŒ· Design Idea ðŸŒ·</b></p>
<p>I came from Taipei, a city I've called home for over three decades. To me, Taipei is more than just a place - it's a living story, nestled among mountains like a secret place on the earth. Taiwan itself is cradled by the sea, an island wrapped in waves and wonder. Taipei is a red ruby glowing in a sea of blue, a spark where memories are born and treasures of excitement wait to be found.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>ðŸŒ· Research ðŸŒ·</b></p>
<p>The original design brief:</p>
<p>(1) Golden ratio in nature: The golden ratio in nature can be seen in every leaf and petal, which grows in a meticulously crafted manner.
Conceptualized with the concept of the golden ratio, our logo is composed of alternatively-arranged circles of different sizes, presenting a complex layering of geometric optical illusions, which provides a kaleidoscopic experience for visitors to appreciate the flower season from unique perspectives.
<p>(2) 12 Flower Seasons - Taipei, a City Surrounded by Mountains and Rivers. Located in the central hinterland of Taipei Basin, surrounded by five main mountain ranges such as Datun and Nangang Mountain Range, with Tamsui River, Keelung River, Dahan River, and Xindian River flowing through, Taipei is a city enriched by abundant natural beauty.
In the intersection between circles of the logo lies 12 petals, representing Taipeiâ€™s 12 iconic flower seasons, which take turns to paint the city with a kaleidoscope of colors.</p>

<b><p>ðŸŒ· Online Banner Design ðŸŒ·</p></b>
<p>From Adobe Photoshop to Illustrator, art reveals itself in countless formsâ€”each stirring a unique emotion, each weaving its own enchantment. In this project, I explored two distinct approaches to banner design: one using photography to evoke a poetic atmosphere, and the other employing illustration with a 3D effect to create visual depth and dimension.</p>

<br>
<b><p>ðŸŒ· Mobile App Design ðŸŒ·</p></b>
<p>Using Figma, I designed a tourist app that showcases the story behind each tulip and recommends a song to enhance the floral experience.</p>

<h2>RESOURCEFUL</h2>
<br>
<p> ðŸŒ¿ MA Group Project: RESOURCEFUL explores how we adjust to life in a climate emergency. With living standards decreasing and our health and wellbeing under threat, the present moment feels increasingly unstable. A safer and more equitable future is clearly desirable, even necessary, but what might it look like?</p>
<p> ðŸŒ¿ Tools: Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, TouchDesigner, 3D Workshop</p>
<p> ðŸŒ¿ This page highlights my expertise in refining presentation materials that captivate diverse audiences from different backgrounds.</p>
<p> ðŸŒ¿ Some graphic credits go to Xiong Ying, Wei, and Muqing.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>ðŸŒ¿ Initial Ideas ðŸŒ¿</p></b>
<br>
<p>I was interested in the topic of Net Zero. I shared the ideas with our teammates,
but they wanted to do more research on Climate Justice and Green Transition.
Therefore, my ideas were not taken into further discussion. However, I still wanted to
share my thinking process of the Net Zero.</p>
<br>
<p>Idea 1: A body in the form of a planet: Gaia And Philosophy</p>
<p>Idea 2: Zombie Media - Tamagotchi</p>
<p>Idea 3: Rewilding with Synthetic Biology (2013 - 2015)</p>
<br>
<b><p>ðŸŒ¿ Research ðŸŒ¿</p></b>
<p>Example 1: Israeli plant regulation VS Palestinian herb-picking culture</p>
<p>Example 2: The Green Colonialism of Norwayâ€™s Wind Power Boom</p>
<br>
<b><p>ðŸŒ¿ Feedback ðŸŒ¿</p></b>
<p>As there is no right and wrong in building wind turbines, it is a tool to save global
warming, but there are plenty of compromises and sacrifices, both the SÃ mi people and
the Norwegian government needs to negotiate. We aim to reveal the story behind the
scenes of the green transition, for the audience to think about Climate Injustice.</p>

<b><p>ðŸŒ¿ Conclusion ðŸŒ¿</p></b>
<p> Green is the elusive color is our topic. We were not picking a side of whether
the green transition is good or not. We only hope the government, companies, and the
indigenous people can find the balance. Renewable energy is a great intention to save
our earth, but exploiting aboriginal livelihood is not the best solution. Moving onshore
wind farms to offshore wind farms may be a better option. However, regulating the
offshore route and policy is another problem. Humans are always creating problems
and finding solutions. From this project, we were also speaking up for people with
fewer resources.</p>
